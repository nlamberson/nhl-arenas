# NHL Arenas Frontend

This package contains the NHL Arenas app.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Expo development server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

3. Launch the app:

   ```sh
   # iOS simulator (requires Xcode)
   npm run ios

   # Android emulator or connected device
   npm run android

   # Expo Web preview
   npm run web
   ```

## Environment

Create a `.env` file (not committed) with your Firebase configuration and any environment-specific values required by the app.

When using Expo Go, secrets should be configured via Expo's environment tooling (EAS secrets or runtime environments) before production releases.
